This is a 90-minute OpenMP Offloading tutorial, presented at TACC.
See OpenMP_Offload_slides_kent_2025.pdf slides file.
Basic operations/concepts of code were explained in the presentation as
attendees followed the slides, and the grammar/syntax review at after
talking through the coded examples.
(Non-tutorial viewers should read grammar/syntax text after 
the code sections first, then peruse code.)

The basics directory contains subdirectories of exercises prefixed
with a number which recommends the order to work through the exercises.

While you can simply perform the TODO_# comments in the codes to perform
the basic offload feature(s), please read the README.md for additional
things to try, and explanations about the features.  There are also question
to help you think about and understand offloading behavior.

See the solutions directory for the answers: 
the OpenMP Offload coded programs and answers to the README.md questions.
